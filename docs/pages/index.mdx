## What is ERC-6900?

ERC-6900 is laying the groundwork for a future of permissionless innovation in modular smart accounts. By standardizing account interfaces and modules, ERC-6900 seeks to make it easier for developers to build secure, interoperable and composable modular smart accounts and modules.

## Why ERC-6900?

ADD THE WHY HERE

## The Standard

ERC-6900 seeks to foster a growing ecosystem of both smart account and module developers by standardizing basic functions and interfaces. At a high level, it does this by standardizing how accounts and modules interact with each other, as well as the pre-installation requirements for modules.

More specifically, the standard focuses on two key goals:

1. Provide standards for designing modules for smart contract accounts.
2. Provide standards for how compliant accounts should interact with modules.

## Reference Implementation

The reference implementation of ERC-6900 can be found [here](https://github.com/erc6900/reference-implementation).

  This is an unaudited implementation that excludes certain optimizations in
  favor of clarity.
