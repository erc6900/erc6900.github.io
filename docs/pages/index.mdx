## What is ERC-6900?

ERC-6900 is laying the groundwork for a future of permissionless innovation in modular smart accounts. By standardizing account interfaces and modules, ERC-6900 seeks to make it easier for developers to build secure, interoperable and composable modular smart accounts and modules.

## Why ERC-6900?

ADD THE WHY HERE

## The Standard

ERC-6900 seeks to foster a growing ecosystem of both smart account and plugin developers by standardizing basic functions and interfaces. At a high level, it does this by standardizing how accounts and plugins interact with each other, as well as the pre-installation requirements for plugins.
More specifically, the standard focuses on two key goals:
Provide standards for designing plugins for smart contract accounts.
Provide standards for how compliant accounts should interact with plugins.
To learn more about the standard and its goals, read this blog post.

## Reference Implementation

The reference implementation of ERC-6900 can be found at erc6900/reference-implementation. This is an unaudited implementation that excludes certain optimizations in favor of clarity.[REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION](https://github.com/erc6900/reference-implementation) HERE

### Working Group Discussion

The working group of ERC-6900 developers meet once a week to discuss standard improvements. Weekly summaries from these calls are available [on Github](https://github.com/erc6900).

If you're interested in more active participation with the working group discussions, please comment on [this Github issue](https://github.com/erc6900/reference-implementation/issues).

### Standard Improvements

Ideas and proposals for standard improvements are found in [Issues](https://github.com/erc6900/reference-implementation/issues).

### Roadmap
