## What is ERC-6900?

ERC-6900 is laying the groundwork for a future of permissionless innovation in modular smart accounts. By standardizing account interfaces and modules, ERC-6900 seeks to make it easier for developers to build secure, interoperable and composable modular smart accounts and modules.

## Why ERC-6900?

ERC-6900 was created to address fragmentation in smart contract accounts by introducing a standardized modular framework. While ERC-4337 abstracts execution and validation logic, custom features like session keys, subscriptions, and spending limits currently require platform-specific implementations or proprietary module systems. This leads to poor user experience, platform lock-in, and duplicated development efforts.

ERC-6900 standardizes modular smart contract accounts, enabling seamless integration of standard-conformant modules. These modules can include execution logic, validation functions, and hooks for pre- and post-execution controls. By adopting this standard, smart contract accounts gain modular, upgradable functionality, improving security, interoperability, and ease of development.

## The Standard

[ERC-6900](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6900) seeks to foster a growing ecosystem of both smart account and module developers by standardizing basic functions and interfaces. At a high level, it does this by standardizing how accounts and modules interact with each other, as well as the pre-installation requirements for modules.

More specifically, the standard focuses on two key goals:

1. Provide standards for designing modules for smart contract accounts.
2. Provide standards for how compliant accounts should interact with modules.

## Reference Implementation
